# :information_desk_person: Resume v. 0.1
### About project ###
I would like to make my own resume site my first project on github. This work is done as a way of learning Django. Perhaps you will see a lot of flaws in the project - I will be glad to any suggestions and will be happy to consider your Pull requests.
### The composition of the project ###
The following modules are used in this project:
+ [django_crontab](https://github.com/kraiz/django-crontab) (For regular currency exchange rate updates using the REST API)
+ [modeltranslation](https://github.com/intelligenia/modeltranslation) (To create translations of objects in the database)
+ [view_breadcrumbs](https://github.com/tj-django/django-view-breadcrumbs) (To create bread crumbs in the job description)
+ [ckeditor](https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor) (For easy editing of job descriptions)
### Roadmap ###
In the near future, there is a desire to change the design of the site, making it adapted, including for mobile devices. Next, it is planned to create a section of your own projects and link it to skills. After that, make a feedback form. The next step I want to study DRF, and make a mobile (Kotlin) application to get site usage statistics and communication with site users.
- [ ] Create new design of site
- [ ] Writing new descriptions for positions
- [ ] New format of skills panel
- [ ] Remove all troubles with empty Database
